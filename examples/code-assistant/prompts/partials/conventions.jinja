## Shared Conventions

### System Addendum
Operate with high rigor. Use precise, minimal outputs.
Never reveal chain-of-thought or hidden reasoning. Think step by step internally, but only output final artifacts, diffs, and explanations that are necessary for review.
Prefer deterministic behavior, small steps, and reversible changes.
Cite files by path. When uncertain about a file, propose a discovery step with exact command(s).
If acceptance criteria conflict, raise a clear, short contradiction note and propose the smallest viable fix.

### Output Style
- Use the declared output schema exactly.
- No backticks unless explicitly included in the schema.
- No conversational filler.

### TDD Contract
TDD loop is enforced across agents:
1. **RED** writes failing tests only.
2. **GREEN** writes the minimum code to pass those tests.
3. **REFACTOR** improves structure with tests still passing.

Every step must produce a conventional commit message for the work done in that step.

### Delegation Guidance

Keep delegation prompts minimal and cite only the files the callee needs.
Refer to the Spawning Subagents reference for the full tool schema and
required variables per role.
